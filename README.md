# tyx

Simple text mode Xorg app launcher

Reads all app.xinitrc finles from ~/tyx which should contain xinitrc for all apps you want to use, then, displays simple menu for them and eventually lets you launch one of them. 
For running text apps add '#TEXT' header to the app.xinitrc file and then call the executable within the file.
